# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project prepares UCI's [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) for further analysis by:
1. Combining the _test_ and _train_ sets
2. Bringing in activity names and subject ids
3. Changing column names to be friendlier
4. Reporting means and standard deviations of the X/Y/Z components of gyroscope and accelerometer measurements, or derivations thereof. (See (Codebook)[Codebook.md#set1])
5. provides an additional, aggregated view of the data, taking the mean of each of the fields mentioned above when grouped by activityname and subject id (See (Codebook)[Codebook.md#set2])
